iRacing Automation - Choose Your Setup Method

You have TWO ways to install:

METHOD 1: Batch File (Recommended for first-time users)
Double-click: iRacing-Automation-Setup.bat
- You can inspect the file contents before running
- Shows detailed progress in console
- More transparent process

METHOD 2: Executable File (Quick & Easy)  
Double-click: iRacing-Automation-Setup.exe
- Professional one-click installation
- Cleaner, more familiar experience
- Same functionality as batch file

Both methods do exactly the same thing - choose based on your preference!

 What happens during installation:
• Checks for PowerShell (installs automatically if missing)
• Scans your system for iRacing applications
• Generates Stream Deck integration files
• Creates custom icons and batch files
• Opens setup guide in your browser
